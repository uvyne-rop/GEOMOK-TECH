      "BERT—which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a Natural Language Processing technique—is an algorithm that has been added to Google Search to improve the accuracy and relevance of the search results produced. On October 21, 2019, Google officially activated BERT for English-language queries and featured snippets.",
    mainDescription:
      'BERT collaborates with previously existing Google algorithms to facilitate a clearer understanding of the searches users make by helping the system better recognize the natural language patterns people use. This enables Google Search to identify and deliver more appropriate information—results that better match the user’s input. It does not compromise or serve as a substitute for another algorithm but rather builds on the latticework foundation established by previous updates, including Fred, Possum, Mobilege, Pigeon, Hummingbird, Penguin, and Panda.',

I don't know how to make one, they say. It can't really make that much of a difference, they insist. Well, experience has shown us the following three counters to these objections. Websites don't have to be expensive, they can be quite easy to create, and they do in fact make a huge difference in a business's growth and sustainability.",

      'Think of a diamond as being the product. The number of carats, for example, is a feature. The benefits, however, can be how the product will make you feel, how it will change your view of the person who gave it to you, or even how others regard you because you now wear the diamond ring! In business, a benefit will generally describe something that moves your prospect away from pain, or from frustration to pleasure, or how your service will help them achieve, you fill in the blank. You must master this distinction because people rarely buy based on features. Most buying decisions are highly emotional and sell out to benefits.',

      "We often hear success stories about new businesses immediately hitting the profit jackpot. In reality, though, most companies – if they’re able even to stay open – don’t make a profit for at least several years. If you’re a new business owner, you’ve hopefully planned for this delay in income but remain eager to start bringing in more money. After all, earning money is one of the reasons you decided to become an entrepreneur in the first place.  It takes hard work to learn how to make a profit in business. You’ll need the right knowledge, strategies and tools, a viable plan, and a commitment to continuous and neverending improvement.",

      'What does it really mean to make a profit? The money coming into your company is considered revenue, but before the money hits your bank account, you’ll have to cover business costs such as payroll, taxes, supplies and other expenses. What’s left is your profit margin – the magic number that determines whether you’ll stay in business, experience explosive growth or be forced to close your doors.  You also need to understand financial statements and basic financial terms. You can’t fly a plane without knowing how to read the gauges; the same applies to business. Learn how to read a balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, and you’ll be able to participate in conversations about how to make a profit.',
